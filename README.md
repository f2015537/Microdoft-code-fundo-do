We want to come up with a post-disaster solution for a flood-stricken area. At such a moment many people get stuck in clogged areas and supply of food, provisions and safe areas become scarce. We came up with a solution to help such people in distress. Using map altitude data we can learn about areas with high and low altitudes. We can also learn whether a building in the vicinity has a high capacity to give refuge to people stuck in water clogged area. Marking such high altitude safe areas can help people establish centers of care during such a disaster. Most common deaths during floods are drowning and hypothermia thus centers like these can be used as safe havens for people. Many people are stuck in low altitude areas where their houses get swept away or they get stuck among high torrid floods. Rescue teams can use this data to help such people. We can roll out this data in the form of flood awareness apps.

In times of floods or general disasters, the news gets released which can be essential for survival. For example, not to enter a particular suburb because of water clogging. People fail to notice such news among all the news available online. Also, some people cannot read English so we will translate the news and make it available in the app as a notification/warning.

Hyperspectral images are provided online which can give a temperature profile of the area. We can learn the water temperature from the land areas and estimate the areas which are water clogged and which areas are still dry.

A chatbot can be added to the app which provides specific solutions to people based on their situation.


Technologies to be used:-
1) CNN or simple image processing to urban population densities based on building sizes obtained from satellite images and altitude data.
2) Open source news APIs to get the latest news.
3) Open source translation API for translation from the source language to possibly all Indian languages.
4) Open source altitude data to identify high and low lying areas.
5) Tensorflow
6) RASA Core + RASA NLU
7) MongoDB
8) Express,Nodejs
9) Angular
10) Mocha and karma for backend testing
11) Jasmine for angular testing.
12) ESLint
